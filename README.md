#   :new_moon: Gradobor  :full_moon:

## Gradobor is a text-based rpg game where the whole concept is based on interactions between users - you create your own character, and then move on to talk in the tavern, or go on a big adventure with other users! You choose!

### Technologies used: React, React Router, Redux, Firebase (authentication, databases, firebase cloud)

#### At the moment the game is still in the alpha phase, but additional features will be gradually added to the game. Most of the stuff on the backend is already done and ready to be deployed, so... now I just need to find some time and add it to the front-end  :ok_hand:

## :x: Currently Firebase screwed me up, cuz Cloud functions ain't free anymore, so will migrate some of the functions somewhere else... Working on it! :x:

#### Game is still not ready, but if you want to take a look how it will look like - https://gradobor-rpg.web.app/


#### Changes (I will update this section once I'm finished with something):


* MVP front-end created; design of most of the elements made in photoshop  :white_check_mark:
* Created a fully-working back-end - authentication, databases and firebase cloud notification system  :white_check_mark:
* Adding advanced hero creator  :x:
* Adding experience system  :x:
* Adding taverns  :x:
* Adding message board for adventures  :x:
* Once Beta will be released -> new hosting  :x:
